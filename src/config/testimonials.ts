    text: 'Alex and I have been working together for quite some time on one of the really big and complex projects I have ever worked on so far. And here is the thing about Alex, whenever I needed some changes only to suit my end he would come up with a good solution, not a dirty fix but trying best to cover the future needs. What can you say about a dev who says, "Quazi, I had a dream about the problem we were talking about and I solved the problem in my dream". He is talented, dedicated, focused, easygoing and I can say from my experience he can be asset to any team.',

    text: `Where do I begin? Alex made every exchange productive and entertaining! With an unwavering positive attitude he was an absolute legend in the office. He added creative value and in most cases quite a critical approach to everything he touched. He is one of those rare employees you hear about but never quite get the chance of working with. I would say that his only weakness is that he is Vegan but let's be real, that's not really a weakness is it?!`,
